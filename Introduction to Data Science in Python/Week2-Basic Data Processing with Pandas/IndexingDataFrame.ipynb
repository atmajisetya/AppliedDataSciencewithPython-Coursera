The index is essentially a row level label, and in pandas the rows correspond to axis zero. Indices can either be either autogenerated, such as when we create a new Series without an index, in which case we get numeric values, or when we loaded data from the CSV file and set appropriate parameters. Another option for setting an index is to use the set_index()function. THis function takes a list of columns and promotes those columns to an index. In this lecture we'll explore more about how indexes work in
