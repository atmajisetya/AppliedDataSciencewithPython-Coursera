Missing values are pretty common in data cleaning activities. And, missing values can be there for any number of reasons, and i just want to touch on a few here.\n","\n","For instance, if you are running a survey and a respondant didnt answer a qestion the missing value is actually an omission. This kind of missing data is called **Missing at Random** if there are other variables that might be used predict the variable which is missing. In mmy work when i delivery surveys I often find that missing data, say the interest in being involved in a follow up study often has some correlation with another data field, like gender or ethnicity. If there is no relionship to other variables, then we call this data **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**.\n","\n","There are just two examples of missing data, and there are many more. For instance, data might be missing because it wasn't collected, either by the process responsible for collecting that data, such as a researcher, or because it wouldnt make sense if it were collected. This last example is extremely common when you start joining DataFrames together from multiple sources, sucah as joining a list of people at a university with a list of offices in the university (students generally dont have offices).\n","\n","Lets look at some ways of hanling missing data in pandas."],"metadata":{"id":"oM5UUw273CgS"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"5vQzvbOFzHzR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659146299550,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1411,"user":{"displayName":"ATMAJI SETYA P","userId":"14409088891786135677"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# lets import pandas\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Pandas is pretty good at detecting missing values directly from underlying data formats, like CSV files.\n","# altough most missing values are often formatted as NaN, NULL, None, or N/A, sometimes missing values are\n","# not labeled so clearly.
